Code Review for Hyperbolic Sine Function

Reviewer : Xindi

#Line 18 Comment consistency within class

@return double value names dResultàchange to @return hyperbolic sine function value

#Line 2, 3, 6, 35, 59 and 61 extra vertical whitespace

within method bodies, should use single blank line

#Line 38 to 44 avoid duplication

i.e. Line 38 summationOfElements =summationOfElements + elementInSeries;

àchange to summationOfElements += elementInSeries;

#Line 55 need horizontal whitespace between variables and operator

dResult=summationOfElementsàchange to dResult = summationOfElements;
