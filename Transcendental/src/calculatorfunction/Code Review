Code Review for: Dan Thagard (Log(x))

1. For calculateE() method
	- Change method name from calculateE() ----> E() or simply rename the static variable E_NUMBER ---> E
	Reference:	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html
	- set dResult =1;
	- dResult +=1/factorial; 
	- return dResult;
	//Simply to maintain consistency to specify which type of result outputs among all team members. 
	
2. For ln() Method
	- Add dInput and/or specific what kind of input it is exactly (change in JavaDoc accordingly).
	- Also for result --> sum and return possibly strictly dResult, which is dResult = floor + sum.

3. For powerOfInt() method
	- Input should have type association (double dBase, int iExp)
	- Change result ---> dResult so as to return either dResult or 1/dResult
	//Simply to maintain consistency to specify which type of result outputs among all team members.
	- Make changes to the JavaDoc as such.

Notes:
Possibly put ln() method at the end so as to first put in accessory methods first in class.  Simply to keep ordering.
General test with comparison to Math.Log and results were good. Methods are functional.
