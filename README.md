# Natural logarithm

## First method
This method provides an implementation for the base 10 logarithm, and then computes the natural logarithm by dividing the result by log(E). It is the fastest of the logarithm methods, and has the benefit of having the base 10 logarithm function included. It is based on the following principle:
