Choose the implementation of Hyperbolic Sine because:
1. it is one of the utilization of exponential function in Trigonometric. It would be interested to discover.
2. Its result can be derived from the exponential function, (exp(x)+exp(-x))/2, therfore it can be calcuated from numerical method of exp(x), also it could find its own numerical approach. It would be interested to compare and find the difference.
3. Its has the property of odd symmetric, and when x-->infinity, sinh(x)--> infinite. It would be interested to observe the numerical result's accuracy when input radians being negative, and bening infinitely large.
