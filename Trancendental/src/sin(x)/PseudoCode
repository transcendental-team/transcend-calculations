Algorithm sine(x):
//Pre-condition: User inputs value in Radians
//Post-condition: The sine of the user input Radians in returned 
Convert Radians to an angle between -2π and 2π:
x  ←x%2 π;

Initialize first term of the series and denominator: 
result ← x
factorial ← 1

Perform n iterations of the Taylor Series Maclaurin Expansion: 

For i to n interations:

	Calculate denominator at each iterations:
	factorial ←factorial*( (2 * i + 2) * (2 * i + 3))

	Calculate numerator at each iterations:
	x ←x* x2;

	if i is even:  
	result ← result – x/factorial

	else:
	result ← result + x/factorial

return result
