## 1)  public static final double Pi ------- "Pi" change to "PI" 

Reference: http://www2.hawaii.edu/~tp_200/ics111/material/codingStandards.html

To name constants use uppercase for each word and separate each pair of words with an underscore. This is only applicable in constant naming.
final double PI = 3.1416;

## 2) 			public static final double sine1(double dRadians) {
##              double output -------------------"output" change to "dResult"

"dResult", 'd' stands for double value. "dResult" is unified as the return value name for all of team member function.

## 3)       	public static final double sine1(double dRadians)  -------------------- "sine1" change to "sin"

Reference: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html

method naming convention matches to Java.lang.Math.sin(double a). Returns the trigonometric sine of an angle.

## 4)     	public static final double sine1(double dRadians) {
##              		double thetaMultiple = dRadians * dRadians;  ---------------------"thetaMultiple" change to "radiansMultiple" 

Name consistency. Input names dRadians, dRadians * dRadians, should be "radiansMultiple"
